# Hybrid

Hybrid is a role playing game.

## Story

There is not currently a story. The aim is a working game, then a story.

## Data format

### Game Data

Game data is currently a mixture of json files and PNGs. This will be expanded to audio files for music and sound effects. 
Eventually, all the files may be packed into an archive format representing a game.

The following data types make up the game data:
* **Races** - these are the descriptions of monsters, their behaviours, and their sprites
* **Spritesheets** - TBD
* **Levels** - These are currently using the Tiled mapeditor's json format. This may be changed to a custom format.
* **Items** - TBD
* **Manifest** - Lists the data files within the data pack

### Scripting

There are currently no facilities for scripting in-game events.

### Language Sets

Translations for the UI are stored within a language set file
